# Introduction

## Overview

Tspec is a library to generate API document from [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) types.

It automatically parses your TypeScript types and generates up-to-date OpenAPI specification with beautiful [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).


## Why tspec?

- **Code First**: Rely on TypeScript type and JSDoc to generate OpenAPI Specification.
- **Easy to learn**: No need to learn new OpenAPI Spec syntax. Just use TypeScript types.
- **Easy to use**: Only few lines of code are needed to generate OpenAPI Specification.
- **Flexible**: You can use any framework you want. It doesn't impose any framework-specific constraints.
